	<p class='text'>Fish Happens is a <span id='friend'> User-Friendly</span> app for fisherman of <span id='under'>all abilities</span> who simply want to know how to plan for the current weather at their favorite spot. We agree that it's better to <span id='how'>'Know Before You Go'</span>, so we decided to make an App that would provide exactly that: The most up-to-date conditions for weather and streamflow.
